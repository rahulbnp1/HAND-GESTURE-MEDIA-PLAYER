Hand Gesture Media Player

Project Overview

The Hand Gesture Media Player is an innovative application designed to provide a hands-free, intuitive interaction with media players. By utilizing advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system accurately recognizes hand gestures and translates them into media control commands, such as play, pause, volume adjustment, and track navigation. This project aims to enhance user experience, especially in scenarios where traditional input devices are inconvenient or impractical.

Key Features

Gesture Recognition: Detects and interprets predefined hand gestures for controlling media playback.

Hands-Free Operation: Allows users to interact with the media player without physical input devices.

Seamless Integration: Designed to work with popular media players and operating systems.

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and accessible interface for easy configuration and use.
